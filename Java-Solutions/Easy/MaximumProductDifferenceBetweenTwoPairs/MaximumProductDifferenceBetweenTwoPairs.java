/*
The product difference between two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) is defined as (a * b) - (c * d).
For example, the product difference between (5, 6) and (2, 7) is (5 * 6) - (2 * 7) = 16.
Given an integer array nums, choose four distinct indices w, x, y, and z such that the product difference between pairs (nums[w], 
nums[x]) and (nums[y], nums[z]) is maximized.
Return the maximum such product difference.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,6,2,7,4]
Output: 34
Explanation: We can choose indices 1 and 3 for the first pair (6, 7) and indices 2 and 4 for the second pair (2, 4).
The product difference is (6 * 7) - (2 * 4) = 34.
